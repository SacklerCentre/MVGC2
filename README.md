# MVGC2

This is Version 2 of the MVGC Multivariate Granger Causality MATLAB software suite.

The MVGC2 project will enhance and extend the existing open-source MVGC Multivariate
Granger Causality MATLAB toolbox (see github.com/SacklerCentre/MVGC1). This project
will update the current MVGC: (i) to take advantage of new state-of-the-art state-space and
spectral methods developed in-house; (ii) to implement the MVGC functionality in Python
(MVGC2-P); and (iii) to integrate the MVGC functionality with the popular neuroimaging
software suites EEGLAB (MVGC2-EEGLAB) and MNE (MVGC2-MNE). The enhanced algorithms, as well
as improving on efficiency and accuracy, also address some well-known problems associated
with standard Granger causality inference from neuroimaging data. The Python implementation
and EEGLAB/MNE integration facilitate users to deploy the MVGC functionality within their
standard toolchains.
