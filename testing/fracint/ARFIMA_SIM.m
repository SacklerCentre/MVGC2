function [Z] = ARFIMA_SIM(N,F,O,d,stdx,er)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The code performs the simulation of time series with autoregressive
%fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) models that generalize
%ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) and ARMA autoregressive
%moving average models.  ARFIMA models allow non-integer values of the
%differencing parameter and are useful in modeling time series with long memory.
%The model is generally represented  as ARFIMA(p,d,q) model where d is the differencing parameter
%and p and q are the order of the autoregressive and moving average parts of the model respectively.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% INPUTS
%%%->N =  # % Length of the time series we would like to generate
%%%->F = [ F1 F2 F3 .... ] % Parameters of the AR model, length(F) is the order p. Default p = 0
%%%->O = [ O1 O2 O3 .... ] % Parameters of the MA model, length(O) is the order q. Default q = 0
%%%->d = # ; % Fractionally differencing parameter, default d = 0
%%%->stdx = % Optional input: parameter to force the standard deviation of the
%output time series. Impose std(Z)==stdx
%%%-->er = % Optional input: predefined time seres of white noise
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%% THE ARFIMA PROCESS IS DEFINED AS:
%%%% F(B)[(1-B)^d]Z=O(B)er
%%%% F(B)Z=[(1-B)^-d]O(B)er
%%%%%%% where B is the backshift operator,
%%%% F(B)= 1+ B F1 + B^2 F2 ... + B^p Fp --> AR PART
%%%% O(B)= 1+ B O1 + B^2 O2 ... + B^q Oq --> MA PART
%%%% er = white noise, it can be specified as an input
%%% Note that F(B) and O(B) are both defined with plus sign as in the "armax" function of matlab
%and in  Box et al., (1994).
